## About
This project was created to store and keep track of the books read individual readers. You click on new book, fill the form and you create book items which represent the books you've read or are currently reading.
## How it works
Each time you click a button, chances are everything on the screen is being created from scratch all over again.

### When you create and add a new book :
A new book object is created and that object is added to an array. The screen is cleared of all book items which were previously there and new book items are created from the updated array which now includes your latest entry.

### When you change the read status of your book :
The book's read status changes in the array, the screen is cleared of all book items which were previously there and new book items are created from the updated array.

Note: The buttons have already been color coded according to read status therefore, if a book item is being created it's read button will take a background color according to its read status.

### When you remove a book item:
The book item is removed by it's index. The screen is cleared of all book items which were previously there and new book items are created from the updated array which does not include the array that was removed.
